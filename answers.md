Activity 6 questions:
1: 5+6
2: Yes, because you can't end up with an even number of number cards, so they have to be face cards. If there are only three left, that means three other triplets of face cards have been replaced, which means the three remaining must be jack, queen, and king.
3. No, because if you have more than one play possible on one turn, then there will be a play available on the next turn no matter which one you pick.
